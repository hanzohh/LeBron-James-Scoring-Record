# LeBron-James-Scoring-Record

This is an R Code Analysis to see/forecast if I can figure out when LeBron James will end up breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's all-time scoring record in the 2022-2023 season. 

Below are the screenshots of the conditions right now that are given. 

1) The standings for the all-time scoring record #1 & #2

2) Bovada's odds for which game LeBron will break the record in

10/17/2022: LeBron needs 1326 points to surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's all-time scoring record. Based on the data I pulled and some simple analysis, I project that LeBron James can break the all-time scoring record between 50-74 games within the season. This would mean from 1/28/2023 (vs. Boston Celtics) to 3/24/2023 (vs. OKC Thunders).

Based on the average points per game, LeBron would have to play 50 games straight to break the record around 1/28/2023. But since LeBron James joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018, he has played about 68% of the season's games. Therefore, I predict and would put my money on LeBron James beating the all-time scoring record with the **+600 At Memphis Grizzlies on 3/24/2023 or Later**.
